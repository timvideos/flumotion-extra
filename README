Flumotion web provides a UI for administrating flumotion servers ike the
flumotion-admin but on the web.

You need the following dependencies to run the web interface;
  * flumotion
  * orbited
  * stompclient


Set Up
========================================================================
This section assumes you have a working flumotion setup. If not please use
setup flumotion first.

Once set up you'll have a chain which lookes like the below;

    flumotion-manager
           /\ 
           ||
          7531 
           ||
           \/
     flumotion2stomp.py
           /\  
           ||
          61613 
           ||
           \/
        orbited
           /\ 
           ||
          8080 
           ||
           \/
      web browser


Step 1 - Setting up orbited
---------------------------------------
First we need to start a local orbited server which. orbited will listen on
both port 8000 and port 61613 and translate between them.

You can use the provided orbited.cfg file and start the server using:

 # easy_install orbited
 # orbited --config orbited.cfg

(If you want the output to go to a log file use orbited-log.cfg)


Step 2 - Setting up flumotion2stomp
---------------------------------------
Next we need to start up the flumotion2stomp.py program.
 
 # python flumotion2stomp.py -m user@localhost -s 61613


Step 3 - Serving the static files
---------------------------------------

You'll also need a web server to serve the HTML/Javascript/etc files. I'm using
Apache because its installed by default.


Step 4 - Connect to the static web server
---------------------------------------

Use a modern web browser, go to your static server.
